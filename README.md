# Piano-flex
Simple piano gui with python (tkinter, pygame) 
,still in progress (Can't believe I called it progress), there's no sound yet though, sincerely, I don't advice you to play this like a piano, it's similar in only few wises, it was an idea that came from boredom, just for coding practice. I guess it was a lot cooler in my head, I'll do my best to transform it soon to something better.
